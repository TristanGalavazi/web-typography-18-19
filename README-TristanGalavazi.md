## Concept

My concept is based around visualising the hidden audiotracks and sounds within the video. First of I listened and watched which background sounds and noises are important to visualise. One of the most imporant sounds is played during both of the baseline tests. The reason behind this sound is to slowly build up tention during the baseline test. I've tried to visualise this sound to an audiowave. The intensity of the audiowave is connected to the background sound of the baseline tests. 
This audiowave is also played wihtin an old-school television that is placed next to the video. The old-school television has to represent the equipment that is used in the first Blade Runner movie during the baseline tests. 

Besides the background sounds during the basline tests I tried to distinguish the difference between the two tests by using different font family's. I also gave the operator and officer-K specific fonts so it is easy to recognise who's talking. 

In the second baseline test there is also an intense score played in the background. I wanted to transelate this intense score by making a background gradient animation that is changing from colors based on the mood of the situation. As soon when officer-K having doubts and showing emotional reactions towards the operators questions the gradient changes colors from (stable) blue to (danger/emotional/love) orange/red.
